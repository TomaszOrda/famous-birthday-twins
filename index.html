        Your (most famous) birthday twin
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </h1> 
    
    <p>Birthday twins are people who share the day and month of their birthday — not necesarily year. 
    However the term should be considered a colloquialism, as there are no references to it in dictionaries.</p>
    
    Use Gregorian calendar for all entries: 
    <label style="margin-bottom: 0.5em" class="switch">
        <input id="gregorian_calendar_toggle" type="checkbox">
        <span class="slider"></span>
    </label> 
    <br>
    <label for="birthday">Your birthday:</label>
    <input type="date" id="birthday" name="birthday" /> 
    <button onclick="updateTable()">Search</button>

    <div id="listOfTwins">
        <h3>On <span id="day"></span> <span id="month"></span> such people were born:</h3>
        
        <table id="listOfTwinsTable">
        </table>
    </div>

    <h4>
        Notes
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </h4>

    <p>The data is not 100% reliable. Some records might be misleading, despite some efforts to filter out people with unknown/amiguous birthdays. There is also issue with the distribution of birthdays — it does not seem to be completely random.</p>
    
    <p>Another issue is the ranking measure. Here <i>linkcount</i> is used, which seems to be doing its job <mark>most of the time</mark>. Moreover it is only one of the countless ways of estimating somebodys fame.</p>
    
    <p>A list of over 8000 most famous people was used. The list should be complete. However it is important to note, that the original query (before filtering mentioned in the first paragraph) had about 10000 results.</p>
